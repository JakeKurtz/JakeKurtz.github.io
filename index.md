# About

Howdy I’m Jake,

I graduated from the University of Calgary in 2022, acheving a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, where I really got into the intersection of math, technology and art.

My attention to detail and problem-solving skills make me a valuable asset as I continue to learn and grow. I’m excited to help push the boundaries of visual storytelling and contribute my aptitude and enthusiasm to a dynamic team. 

Feel free to explore my page and reach out if you’re interested in collaborating or learning more about my work!
