# About

Howdy! I’m Jake, and I’m passionate about visual effects and computer graphics. I’ve got a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University of Calgary, where I really got into the intersection of math, technology and art. My passion for creating stunning visuals and exploring new tech drives me every day.

I’m excited to help push the boundaries of visual storytelling and contribute my skills and enthusiasm to a dynamic team. My attention to detail and problem-solving skills make me a valuable asset as I continue to learn and grow.

Feel free to explore my page and reach out if you’re interested in collaborating or learning more about my work!
